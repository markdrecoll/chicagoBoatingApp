  ## Description
  ChicagoBoatingApp is an application that displays weather, attractions, harbors, and other information relevant to boaters in Chicago. A user is displayed the marine weather forecast for the week, including data like wave height, wave direction, water temperature, wind speed, wind direction, and more. Users can login and record itineraries. Upon seeing the weekly forecast, a user can pick a day they like (presumably due to a factor such as low waves). When the user chooses that day, they are able to record notes, or choose from a list of activities. This data is then saved and the user can review it when they login. Some of the attractions the user can view information on include bars/restaurants with riverside docking, destinations such as Navy Pier or casinos that have dock parking, waterfront firework scheduling, and more.
